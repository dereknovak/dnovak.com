      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello!</p>

      <p>My name is Derek and I'm a Software Engineer based out of Austin, Texas. I come from a robust background in <em>education</em> and <em>customer service</em>, transitioning fully into Software Engineering in 2023.</p>

      <p>I plan to fill up this section at a later date, and simply want something to hold its place.</p>

      <p>Cheers!</p>
