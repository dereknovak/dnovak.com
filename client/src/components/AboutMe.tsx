      <p>Howdy!</p>

      <p>
        I'm a full-stack software engineer from Austin, TX with multiple years
        of experience in the JavaScript and Ruby ecosystems. Recently, I built
        Vispyr, an end-to-end observability platform that automates AWS
        deployment and simplifies telemetry setup for small engineering teams.
        Having earned multiple degrees from distinguished institutions, I
        combine disciplined problem-solving and a passion for continuous
        learning to design elegant, high-impact software solutions.

      <p>When not behind a computer, you can typically find me on a bicycle.</p>

      <p>Cheers!</p>
